This is the landing page developed for our application, Homeroom. Homeroom is a end-to-end service for both teachers and students to stay more connected through virtual learning.

We noticed three problems with virtual learning: 

1) Students lose the ability to engage with their classmates socially. Especially in large classes where it's difficult to communicate privately via call, students lose the ability to socialize.

2) The learning experience tends to be far worse due to lack of immediate teacher support. If I have a question regarding a math problem, it becomes tedious to email my teacher and wait for a response.

3) Teachers often lack important data about how students are handling the class when it is entirely virtual. Even when they have data, it is very difficult to extract useful insights.

We tackled these problems by developing a web application (built with React.js, firebase backend, and a custom NLP server) where teachers can create virtual classrooms for their students. Within these classrooms, teachers can create virtual "table groups" to encourage communication among students. They can also create assignments and provide solutions for all the problems within the assignment. Based on these solutions our automated tutor, Polya, can provide on the spot help for students struggling to fully solve any problems. Instead of providing students with direct hints, we built Polya to encourage the student to understand the next hint themselves.

This landing page summarizes the features of the application with a beautiful user interface and custom illustrations. It also depicts some perks and features for the different tiers of the product we offer along with their prices.
